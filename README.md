This project first studies on Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) based on TransTrack, then evaluates its robustness under challenging conditions such as lighting changes, snow, and motion blur. By augmenting the MOT17 dataset and applying transfer learning, we assess how these factors impact tracking accuracy. Results highlight key strengths and limitations of TransTrack in real-world scenarios, offering insights for future improvements.
